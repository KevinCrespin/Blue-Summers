## The learned 

* Fundamentals of CSS, CSS Media Queries, and CSS Animations.
* Fundamentals of JavaScript ES6.
* Fundamentals of DOM Manipulation with JavaScript ES6.

## The problems

* The website is too simple and repetitive.
* A single html and css file could have been used.
* React or Angular could have been a perfect tool for this project.
* This project will likely **not** be revisited, but problems should be improved in later projects.
